  			Transcript:
  		  </h2>

        <p>Welcome to Module 1: Helpful Definitions.</p>

        <p>This presentation is part of the Non-Profit’s Guide to Lobbying the New York State Legislature and Executive Branch. In this module, we will define and explain nonprofit organizations, advocacy, direct and grassroots lobbying, and common terminology used when groups want to engage in lobbying in New York State. This is the first of 5 modules. This module is for informational purposes only. You should not rely on it as a substitute for, nor does it constitute, legal advice by a competent legal professional.</p>

        <p>This podcast, the other podcasts in this series, and the other materials available on this website are designed to provide general information about the laws and rules that affect organizations and individuals engaged in what is considered lobbying under New York law. What these materials help to explain is what sorts of obligations are imposed on non-profit organizations that engage in lobbying in New York State, with a focus on the reporting requirements that are imposed on those who do engage in such lobbying.</p>

        <p>As we discuss later in this podcast, this information does not relate to the separate and different obligations under federal law that impact a non-profit organization’s ability to engage in lobbying. This material is designed to help you understand what lobbying is under New York law and when the law requires groups engaged in such lobbying to submit reports to New York state officials about such lobbying.</p>

        <p>Please consult an attorney to understand your organization’s specific obligations. This information is not designed to provide tailored, individualized advice or guidance to any specific individual organization.</p>

        <p>Ok, let’s start with some basic definitions.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>NONPROFIT DEFINITION</h3>

        <p>The nonprofit sector is also known as the not-for-profit sector, civil society, the voluntary sector, the third sector, the independent sector, and the nongovernmental sector. This sector is characterized by three features:</p>

        <p>First, nonprofits do not coerce participation. They draw on a large reservoir of goodwill and demand nothing from the community.</p>

        <p>Second, nonprofits operate without distributing profits to stakeholders (this is also known as the non-distribution constraint). While corporations are able to distribute earnings to shareholders, nonprofit organizations cannot make such distributions. Rather, nonprofits must use all of the proceeds and income they receive for the advancement of the organization’s stated charitable purpose or mission.</p>

        <p>This constraint provides reassurance that the nonprofit’s mission takes precedence over the financial benefits that might accrue to anyone involved with the organization. Now, that is not to say that non-profits cannot pay their employees. Of course they can, but the salaries their employees earn must be directed towards serving the public, and not simply to benefit those employees or other individuals with ties to the organization.</p>

        <p>This nondistribution constraint also builds legitimacy and public confidence in a nonprofit. It provides assurance that the funds obtained by the organization are used for a public, NOT private, purpose.</p>

        <p>Lastly, nonprofits exist without simple and clear lines of ownership and accountability. Nonprofit organizations must serve many masters, none of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over the organization. Donors, clients, board members, employees, and local communities all have stakes, claims, and interests in the nonprofit organization, yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as the key ownership group.</p>

        <p>While there should generally be clear lines of communication and decision making authority within an organization, non-profits are accountable to many, including the federal and state governments, that oversee the operation of non-profits; and the community those non-profits serve.</p>

        <p>The largest category of tax-exempt organizations is the §501(c) organization, named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code. Most non-profits fall under sub-section 501(c)(3). If you truly operate a non-profit, this is the section that is most likely applicable to your organization. If you have any questions about what type of organization you are operating or want to operate, consult with an attorney to understand your organization type, or, if you are starting an organization, what type of organization you should form.</p>

        <p>The remainder of these podcasts will be focused on this specific type of nonprofit organization: the 501(c)(3). The IRS explains that section 501(c) grants exemption to 28 different kinds of organizations. But for our purposes, a “charities vs. everything else” distinction is very useful.</p>

        <p>In general, only charities exempt under section 501(c)(3) are eligible to receive additional major tax benefits. At some level, tax exemption for charities is tied to a concept that they are improving general public welfare.</p>

        <p>Now, let’s turn to some other definitions.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>ADVOCACY DEFINITION</h3>

        <p>Advocacy helps your nonprofit achieve its charitable mission. It includes making your voice heard regarding that mission, in ways like: Contacting your local elected officials; inviting these elected officials to meetings, informational sessions, and other events, and; creating a social media or email campaign to promote your mission. Advocacy is more about education and promotion than trying to change the law.</p>

        <p>Through advocacy efforts you can bring light to real community needs and highlight particular social issues that have previously been ignored by policymakers, thus raising awareness, and lower barriers to increase access to important services. For our purposes, it is important to distinguish advocacy from lobbying, which I will turn to next.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>LOBBYING DEFINITION</h3>

        <p>So now you must be wondering, what is lobbying? Lobbying is an attempt to influence government decision making. Here, I will focus on how that term is defined under New York Law. The IRS has a somewhat different definition for lobbying, and you should check with your attorney to assess whether you are engaging in activity that could jeopardize your status as a 501(c)(3) status under federal law if you engage in activity that 501(c)(3) organizations may not engage in.</p>

        <p>You can also consult the companion website to this website, which describes the restrictions surrounding non-profit lobbying under federal law.</p>

        <p>Under New York Law, an organization will be regarded as attempting to influence government decision making if it engages in an activity intended to support, oppose, modify, delay, expedite, or otherwise affect a 1-c(c) Lobbying Activity. These activities include: Passage or defeat of State or Local Legislation or Resolutions, adoption, issuance, rescission or modification of State or Local Executive Orders, or State or Local Rules or Regulations, rate making proceedings by a State Agency or municipality, procurement determinations determined or influenced by: (a) public officials or an entity working in conjunction with a public official; or, (b) an officer, employee, or entity working in conjunction with the unified court system in relation to government contracts, approval, disapproval, implementation or administration of tribal-state compacts, memoranda of understanding, or any other tribal-state agreements, or attempts to influence public officials.</p>

        <p>Once you’ve got that basic understanding of lobbying generally, here’s some additional definitions you will need to know as you work through these podcasts and the rest of the material on this website.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>DIRECT LOBBYING DEFINITION</h3>

        <p>Another important term under New York law is what is known as direct lobbying. Direct lobbying is defined as direct contact with a Public Official to attempt to influence an 1-1(c) lobbying activity or (ii) direct or preliminary contact with a Public Official to enable or facilitate an attempt to influence one of these activities.</p>

        <p>When does direct lobbying occur?</p>

        <p>Direct Lobbying occurs when an Organization has Direct Contact with a Public Official in an attempt to influence any 1-c(c) activity. This includes having Direct or Preliminary contact with a Public Official to facilitate an attempt to influence, such as scheduling a meeting with or making an introduction to a Public official, or having Direct Contact with any member of the Public Officials' staff.</p>

        <p>You can engage in direct lobbying even if the person who you are attempting to influence supports your cause.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>GRASSROOTS LOBBYING DEFINITION</h3>

        <p>Grassroots lobbying: defined as attempts to influence legislation by attempting to affect the opinion of the public with respect to the legislation and encouraging the audience to take action with respect to the legislation.</p>

        <p>When does grassroots lobbying occur? Grassroots lobbying occurs when an organization encourages others to influence legislation by urging those outside the organization to engage in lobbying.</p>

        <p>In order for an activity to count as grassroots lobbying, it must reference or otherwise implicate a 1-c(c) activity. For more information on what a 1-c(c) activity is again, reference the other materials on this website.</p>

        <p>Unlike direct lobbying, grassroots lobbying also requires the activity to include a “call to action,” in which the organization urges members of the public to deliver a message to a Public Official in support of the Organization.</p>

        <p>Just to recap, to engage in grassroots lobbying activity must reference or otherwise implicate an 1-c(c) activity, take a clear position on a government action, and include a call to action. all three elements must be met in order to go from merely educating the public to actively engaging in grassroots lobbying.</p>

        <h3>COMMON JARGON IN NYS LOBBYING</h3>

        <p>Now that we know what lobbying is, and the two main forms of lobbying, it’s important to know jargon used by lobbyists in New York State. Every industry has certain terms they use to refer to critical processes. These terms are known as jargon. In lobbying in New York State, particularly in the capital, common jargon includes:</p>

        <p>Legislative Office Building (LOB): where the senator’s and legislator’s offices are located.</p>

        <p>The second floor: which refers to the governor’s office.</p>

        <p>The well: which is the space in the Legislative Office Building where groups often hold events, typically called lobby days. It is where speakers and participants congregate in such events.</p>

        <p>Concourse: this joins the New York State Capitol building and Legislative Office Building.</p>

        <p>Million-dollar staircase: this is the term used to refer to the grand staircase located off the assembly chamber.</p>
